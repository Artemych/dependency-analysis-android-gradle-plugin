== Install to maven local
----
./gradlew installForFuncTest
----
== Run the tests
To run all the checks:
----
./gradlew check
----
=== Unit tests
----
./gradlew test
----
=== Functional tests
This runs all the functional tests against the full test matrix (all supported versions of AGP and
Gradle). Please be aware this can take a long time.
----
./gradlew functionalTest
----
This runs all the functional tests against only the latest-support combination of AGP and Gradle.
----
./gradlew functionalTest -DfuncTest.quick
----
or
----
./gradlew quickFunctionalTest
----
> Protip. You can also use `./gradlew qFT` and save yourself some typing.

If you want to run tests against only a subset of the suite, use Gradle's `--tests` option
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#simple_name_pattern[support]:
----
./gradlew functionalTest --tests AnnotationProcessorSpec
----
You can combine quick tests with test filtering, but you must use the more verbose quick-test
syntax:
----
./gradlew functionalTest --tests AnnotationProcessorSpec -DfuncTest.quick
----
